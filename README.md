Go to timer2u-app folder and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Problem with cors on browser.
After installed the api  i found some issues with cors on brower, to avoid this u can install a extension on browser to override the coors and avoid the erros.
I used tge a Moesif Origin & CORS Changer extension and worked fine. you can can check the link below:

## TIME SPENT
I spent about 6 hours to create the app and api.

## TODO
Add the form validation, option to continue the timer.
